# Issues Submission Policy
All concerns, questions, feedback, and criticism (constructive or harsh ;) are all very much welcome to be submitted within issues. Please be extremely detailed and provide examples/analogies when submitting so I can quickly fix the issue or provide clarification. Please refrain from posting duplicate issues (check all open issues before submitting).

## When do open issues get closed?
All open issues within this repo will be closed if one of the following criteria is met below:
* The issue is fixed and the issue author is satisfied with the fix.
* The issue does not require a fix (no action is needed) and the issue author does not respond to the repo owner/collaborator's response within 30 days.

Of course, if you have any questions about this policy, you can always submit an issue or contact me at https://tylermorgan.org/contact.
